                <p>BL18 was the result of a school project (CSE135). The result was a functioning Javscript error collection service. The site allows users to add their site URL into our database, and then they will be able to keep track of JS errors once they place our script onto their pages. The site is run on PHP with a MySQL database. 
                    <br><br>
                Before I started this project I knew nothing about Javascript, PHP, Perl, JSP, SQL databases, Apache, or VPS's. Now, I have some experience with each. There was little effort put into front-end aesthetics as this was a back-end class.

                    The Leicester redesign was assigned as a class group project. We looked at the original <a href="http://www.le.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Leicester</a> website, and picked out things we did not like based on design "heuristics" discussed in class, and created a redesign to satisfy those heuristics - hopefully improving the layout of the site.
                    <br><br>
                    The original site uses a unique navigation method on the front page (lacks a navbar), and then a navbar appears once you go one layer deeper into the site. We felt this was a bad idea, and it would be better for the user only have to learn one single navbar. We decided to put a lot of links and content within the navbar dropdowns; this was made simple by using Zurb's Foundation framework. However, Foundation had a bug where if the content dropdown was created on the far right of the screen, it would not adjust itself to expand towards the left; instead it would spawn the dropdown to the right essentially making it off-screen. This was fixed by searching online for various solutions.
                    <br><br>
                    The project ended up quite close to how we wanted it. However, the footer was a disappointment, and is admittedly badly designed. This project was for COGS 187a, and we had one week to complete it; this was the second last project for the course.

                    phonedex was a group project for a cognitive science web design class. Since it was not a computer science class, the groups were mixed with some computer science majors and some cognitive science majors. As a computer science major I took up the majority of the actual coding, and enjoyed the feedback and advice of more creative teammates.
                    <br><br>
                    When I began, I put in effort to get templates out quickly so they could be filled with content by my teammates. The hard part was adhering to the designs that my teammates had come up with. The result was a mock smartphone website that I quite like. This project was for COGS 187a, and we had one week to complete it.

                    If you have to check out something, try the wizard; it does not have a back-end implemented though, so it will always cough out the same results.

                    jmp3player is a completely Java based mp3 player. It contains most basic functions expected in an mp3 player, but also features a media library, where all songs played will be listed for future reference. The player is the result of a final project for my intro Java class at Pasadena City College. Implemented with mp3spi1.9.5 library.
                    <br><br>
                    This is the first project where I had to search for and use a foreign library, and learn how to use it to interface with mp3 files.

                    Chatter Box is a chat client. There is a server counterpart that is run by an admin. Other users then use the provided server  name (given that they are on the same network) and will be able to join that server. Once the user is connected, they will be transferred to a lobby where they can chat with other users also on the server. Chatter Box is written in C++, and implemented with Qt4 libraries. <br><br> Chatter Box is one of my earliest projects as a programmer, and was turned in as a final project for my intro C++ class at Pasadena City College.
