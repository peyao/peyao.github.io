                  iReceptionist is SaaS for any company looking to supplement or completely replace their receptionist.
                  <br><br>
                  It features a marketing front-end, inviting companies to try out iReceptionist. Once they are signed up,
                  they are able to customize their receptionist page, which their walk-in guests/customers are able to use
                  to sign in. The customer is also able to track who is the most popular employee (by however many guests
                  request them on receptionist page), how many guests they are getting over time, and more.
                  <br><br>
                  This was a class project, and as a bonus, we set up a section for our customer, who can manage each of
                  his SaaS customers. He can give them a free month, cancel their subscription, and see some analytics
                  such as how much income iReceptionist is generating.
                  <br><br>
                  This was a large class project; there were 14 members and I was the overall leader of the group. I also
                  led the front-end team, while a separate backend team of 7 was led by another member.

                  eggsnramen is a recipe finding application based on whatever ingredients you have on hand.
                  <br><br>
                  It's a mobile-only web app (sure you can view it on desktop but it will look funny).
                  The user is able to cook immediately with the "Let's Cook" button, where they can select
                  their ingredients. The user is also able to create and account and save their favorite
                  recipes.
                  <br><br>
                  eggsnramen was primarily a design-focused project. This was my first-ever experience with
                  AngularJS (and Ionic!) and I was also the sole developer. I'm extremely proud of this project
                  as it was done in a few weeks -- every day was intense and full of confusion and learning. This
                  was before I had any experience running my own VPS and hosting my own applications, so this is
                  running Heroku.

                  It offers all the basic operations expected from a minimallist key-value store in addition

                <p>BL18 was the result of a school project (CSE135). The result was a functioning Javscript error collection service.

The site is run on PHP with a MySQL database.

                Before I started this project I knew nothing about Javascript, PHP, Perl, JSP, SQL databases, Apache, or VPS's. Now, I have some experience with each. There was little effort put into front-end aesthetics as this was a back-end class.

                    The Leicester redesign was assigned as a class group project. We looked at the original <a href="http://www.le.ac.uk/" target="_blank">University of Leicester</a> website, and picked out things we did not like based on design "heuristics" discussed in class, and created a redesign to satisfy those heuristics - hopefully improving the layout of the site.
                    <br><br>
                    The original site uses a unique navigation method on the front page (lacks a navbar), and then a navbar appears once you go one layer deeper into the site. We felt this was a bad idea, and it would be better for the user only have to learn one single navbar. We decided to put a lot of links and content within the navbar dropdowns; this was made simple by using Zurb's Foundation framework. However, Foundation had a bug where if the content dropdown was created on the far right of the screen, it would not adjust itself to expand towards the left; instead it would spawn the dropdown to the right essentially making it off-screen. This was fixed by searching online for various solutions.
                    <br><br>
                    The project ended up quite close to how we wanted it. However, the footer was a disappointment, and is admittedly badly designed. This project was for COGS 187a, and we had one week to complete it; this was the second last project for the course.

                    phonedex was a group project for a cognitive science web design class. Since it was not a computer science class, the groups were mixed with some computer science majors and some cognitive science majors. As a computer science major I took up the majority of the actual coding, and enjoyed the feedback and advice of more creative teammates.
                    <br><br>
                    When I began, I put in effort to get templates out quickly so they could be filled with content by my teammates. The hard part was adhering to the designs that my teammates had come up with. The result was a mock smartphone website that I quite like. This project was for COGS 187a, and we had one week to complete it.

                    If you have to check out something, try the wizard; it does not have a back-end implemented though, so it will always cough out the same results.
