COGS187a - Design your Portfolio

NOTE -
	(EXTRA CREDIT)
	I have Lightbox used in the "about_me" and "projects" page.
	The home page index.html has an image carousel, but no Lightbox.

BRAND -
	My brand is a minimalistic and casual. The soft rounded borders
	on all the elements promote my casual style. The clean and centered
	elements, with the use of a general gray/black color scheme promote
	my minimalistic style. The images I used are ones taken from everyday
	life, with few pictures of actual code (I am a Comp Sci. major), and
	this tops off the casual and friendly feeling. It shows I have a life
	outside my computer and I can work well with others.
	
HIGH VALUE USERS -
	EMPLOYERS
		This is my highest value group and the one I cater most to. The
		"about_me" page has my resume at the very top as a download link.
		Then it explains how I am as a human, and what my interests are.
		The "projects" page is also mostly centered for this group.
		On the "projects" page I try to highlight what role each project
		played in my life, what kind of skills I had I was when I started 
		it, and what the projects taught me.
	FAMILY/FRIENDS
		The portfolio has a friendly and casual atmosphere for employers
		to consider, but also works for family and friends. They should
		find the CSS Font Awesome icons quite easy on the eyes and easy
		to navigate around. They can easily find my email on the site if
		they have no other way to reach me. The "about_me" page also
		caters to this group.
